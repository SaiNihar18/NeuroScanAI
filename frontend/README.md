## 🧠 About the Model

The application uses the **Xception CNN** architecture to classify brain MRI scans into four categories:
- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-name>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the API endpoint in `.env`:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## 🔌 Backend Integration

### FastAPI Endpoint

The frontend expects a FastAPI backend with the following endpoint:

**POST** `/predict`

**Request:**
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Body: `file` (image file)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "class": "Glioma Tumor",
  "confidence": 0.94
}
```

### Updating the API URL

Edit the `.env` file to point to your FastAPI backend:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```
